    <h1>Eradicating Hunger</h1>

    <p>
        Having a diet which is both sufficient in terms of energy (caloric)
        requirements and diverse to meet additional nutritional needs is
        essential for good health. The UN has set a global target as part of the
        Sustainable Development Goals to "end hunger by 2030". Currently we are
        far from reaching this target.

        Public investment in agriculture globally is declining, small scale food
        producers and family farmers require much greater support and increased
        investment in infrastructure and technology for sustainable agriculture
        is urgently needed.

        An estimated 821 million people - approximately 1 in 9 people in the
        world - were undernourished in 2017, up from 784 million in 2015. Data
        also shows how this statistic is worse in developing countries.

        Between 2014 and the onset of the pandemic, the number of people going
        hungry and suffering from food insecurity had been gradually rising. The
        COVID-19 crisis has pushed those rising rates even higher. The war in
        Ukraine is further disrupting global food supply chains leading to
        widespread hunger issues.
        <br /><br />
        Between 83 and 132 million more people may already have been pushed into
        chronic hunger in 2020.
